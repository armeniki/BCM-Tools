# Nortel BCM
Support tools to maintain the Nortel Business Communication Manager (BCM).

A few years ago Nortel went out of business and was taken over by Avaya.  Avaya took over the Nortel portfolio which included the BCM range of small to medium-large business communication systems (or PBXs).  Unfortunately, Avaya has now stopped supporting these units and many people/business are stuck with hardware they can no longer maintain.  This in addition to the fact that many businesses are now moving to IP-based systems, many BCMs are now being sold on online sites such as eBay. What's worse is there are a lot of units being thrown out into the landfills as e-waste.

For telephone enthusiasts (aka phone-phreaks) like myself who happen to have these units at home, there is, at the moment, no chance of being able to maintain them.  If a board fails, it's game over.   The reason for this is simple:  Despite the fact that many of these units are being sold online, the parts (such as hard drives and main boards) are not interchangeable because each unit is programmed with a unique "System ID" and any change, hardware or software, must be authenticated with a keycode.  Since there is no more support for these units, obtaining keycodes is now impossible.  Keycodes are also required when you want to make a change to your unit, for example, if you want to add more voicemail boxes or increase the number of extensions from 4 to 8, for example.

This repo is aimed at 2 things, creating a password of the day generator and a keycode signature generator.  Both of them are descrbed below.
