# Licence File Generator

This is a simple application which will present the user with all of the features or options that can be modified on the BCM.  Once all of the desired options are selected, the user can then generate a .lic file which is then uploaded to the BCM via Element Manager.

This application does not generate a keycode signature at the moment but it might come in useful nonetheless.
